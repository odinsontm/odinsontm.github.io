<h3>The Leonardo Member Lounge</h3>
<p>This project was apart of CLASS NUM HERE where a team of developers and designers worked together to create a website for a real life client. Our task was to create a membership portal for The Leonardo Museum. This website was in response to the need of a better membership solution for guests of the museum. The portal consisted of a dashboard, access to a digital membership card, newsletter, calendar of events, and exclusive content for members. </p>
<p>Completing this class gave me valuable experience in software design and devleopment. Additionally, this class gave me experience with working in a team of not only developers, but those who may not understand the technical parts of developing a website. Along with experience in creative problem solving skills when things did not go to plan, and how to manage and resolve group issues. </p>

<h3>Number Ninja</h3>
<p>This 2D platfromer was created as a part of CLASS NUM HERE. The goal of the class was to simulate a real world client building job. Our assignment was to create a game that helped 2nd and 3rd graders with their math skills. So, we came up with a 2D platformer where the user acted as a ninja running away from a dragon. Along the way, there were jumps where the user is propted with a math question, in order to land the jump the user would have to answer the question correctly. </p>
<p>This project gave my team members and I experience in software design and development as it applies to game development. It also gave me experience with working in a team, coordinating our work, and solving issues as they arose.</p>
