<h3>The Leonardo Member Lounge</h3>
<p>This project was a part of CMPT 375 where a team of developers and designers worked together to create a website for a real-life client. Our task was to create a membership portal for The Leonardo Museum. This website was in response to the need for a better membership solution for the members. The portal consisted of a dashboard, access to a digital membership card, newsletter, calendar of events, and exclusive content for members.</p>
<p>Completing this class gave me valuable experience in software design and development. Moreover, this class gave me experience working with a team of developers and designers in a production setting. It also gave me practice with my creative problem-solving skills when things did not go to plan. It also strengthened my skills in managing and resolving group issues.</p>

<h3>Number Ninja</h3>
<p>This 2D platformer was created as a part of CMPT 322. The goal of the class was to simulate a real-world client-building job. Our assignment was to create a game that helped 2nd and 3rd graders with their math skills. So, we made a 2D platformer where the user acted as a ninja running away from a dragon. Along the way, there are jumps where the user is prompted with a math question. To land the jump, the user must answer the question correctly. If the user completes all the questions and makes all the jumps, they win the level.</p>
<p>This project gave me experience in software design and development as it applies to game development in a team setting. It also gave me experience working as a team, coordinating work, and solving issues as they arose.</p>
